This homework is more or less a tutorial that helps you set up the coding environment used in this course, and familiarizes you with the format of the assignment submission. 
As a pre-requisite of this homework, first install R, and then the RStudio (the free version of Rstudio Desktop). 

1. Create a folder named `ds202_hw1`, and **either** create an RMarkDown file `hw1.Rmd` under this folder **or** move the provided template into this folder. `hw1.Rmd` will include your solutions. The file and folder names are *case-sensitive*, which means `hw1.Rmd` and `HW1.rmd` are different. *It is crucial to follow the exact folder structure and file names* in this course, so that your homework can be reproduced. The correct folder structure is

```
ds202_hw1
|-- hw1.Rmd
|-- hw1.html (generated after knitting)
```

Answer: Done (Note that the start of your answer on the next line must be indented. Don't remove the leading spaces.)

2. Write your name in the YAML of your homework `Rmd` file.

    Answer: Done

3. Write a paragraph to introduce yourself. Set your name in bold font and your major in italic. 

    Hello! I'm **Ashley Sackpraseuth**, a junior studying *Industrial Engineering* and minoring in Chinese and Data Science. This past summer I was a research intern at Stanford where I investigated trends in the outcomes of heart-lung transplant patients and the disparity in age of diagonsis of diabetes among Asian subgroups. I did this using a ton of R (and Zoom) so I can't wait to see what new skills I will learn in this class! The summer before that I studied abroad in Taiwan where I was first introduced to data science. I really like helping people so if I'm not doing that, I'm either trying out new Pinterest recipes or performing with the ISUCF'V'MB!
  
4. Write a paragraph describing a job that you think is related to data science. Include a hyperlink and an image. Make sure your answer is in a nice format to read. 

    I feel like this is the perfect time to talk more about the research program I did this past summer. I was a part of Stanford's Center for Asian Health Research and Education Summer Research Immersion program where they aim to bridge the gap between healthcare and data science. Through the program I had the privilege of meeting Neil Hunt, the creator of Netflix's AI algorithm. After 18 years, he got bored of it and decided to apply his knowledge to healthcare. He is now the CEO of his new app [Curai](https://curai.com/). [Curai](https://curai.com/) is super cool because it uses AI to make healthcare more affordable and accessible! It uses data science to retrieve medical records, learn from them, and diagnose patients with a higher accuracy than professional doctors.

5. What data topic will you be most interested in? (Optional) Provide a source of such dataset if you have.

    Healthcare. I used the NHIS database and the UNOS databse for my projects but those are hard to interpret without help from a medical expert. 
  
6. To check that your R and Rstudio installation is correct, find the version of R by entering `version` into the R console. Include this command into a R code trunk in your solution `Rmd` file to have it automatically printed in the knitted html file. 

```{r}
version
```


7. Install git. 
    - If you are on Windows: 
        a. Install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/). In the coming weeks we will use the Git Bash (but not the Git GUI). 
        b. After installation, set up Rstudio to use Git bash as the shell for the Terminal: Open RStudio, click Tools--Global Options--Terminal; under **Shells**, select Git Bash; click OK. 
        c. In the main menu of RStudio: click Tools--Terminal--New Terminal. If you have a `$` before your prompt, then you should be good to go.
    - If you are on Linux or macOS, Git has probably been installed by default, so you do not need to install anything. Just click the Terminal tab (above the R Console).

    Answer: Done
  
8. What is the version of your Git? To find out, go to the Terminal tab in RStudio (right to the Console tab), and type in the following command. If it works, this shows that the setup of your terminal and Git is correct. 
<!-- Then explore the bash command line and Git. -->

    ```
    git --version
    ```

    Answer: git version 2.28.0.windows.1
  
9. Configure your git username and user email by modifying and entering the following commands into the terminal

    ```
    git config --global user.name "AshleySackpraseuth"
    git config --global user.email "asackpr@iastate.edu"
    ```

    Answer: Done
  

10. Register a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account. What is your username?

    AshleySackpraseuth
